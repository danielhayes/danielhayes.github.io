        <p>My Dog Boris, LLC is Dan Hayes, independent senior enterprise architect and software engineer specializing in 
            the design and development of highly scalable web applications and micro services deployed both on premise and via 
            cloud services. 
        </p>

        <p>Over the past 5+ years, my work has been focused primarily within the media/cable industry, where I play an important role 
            in the modernization of various important applications and platforms for Comcast NBC Universal. Prior to Comcast, I consulted 
            to numerous companies in financial services, insurance, supply chain and e-commerce industries. In addition, I served as an 
            interim/turnaround CIO/CTO for companies such as JG Wentworth and Storeroom Solutions. Prior to focusing on exclusively on 
            technology, I was an insurance executive with Progressive Insurance and co-founder of internet startup insurer Kemper 
            Direct Auto and Home which was later acquired by Unitrin Direct.
        </p>

        <p>As a Certified Enterprise JAVA Architect for more than 15 years, I am primarily called upon to assist companies who have a bias 
            toward Java-based solutions. As a result, Spring and derivative technologies (such as Spring Boot, Spring Integration, String Data, etc.) 
            have been central to my professional toolkit.  However, as a full-stack architect and developer, I am also well versed in UI 
            application design and development based upon Javascript and single page web application frameworks.  Earlier web framework 
            experience was with AngularJS, however more recently I am turning to Vue.js when projects require user facing applications.</p>
