				<p>
					My Dog Boris, LLC is Dan Hayes, independent senior
					enterprise architect and software engineer specializing in
					the design and development of highly scalable web
					applications and micro services deployed both on premise and
					via cloud services.
				</p>

				<p>
					Over the past 12 years, my work has been focused primarily
					within the media/cable industry, where I play an important
					role in the modernization of various important applications
					and platforms for Comcast NBC Universal. Prior to Comcast, I
					consulted to numerous companies in financial services,
					insurance, supply chain and e-commerce industries. In
					addition, I served as an interim/turnaround CIO/CTO for
					companies such as JG Wentworth and Storeroom Solutions.
					Prior to focusing on exclusively on technology, I was an
					insurance executive with Progressive Insurance and
					co-founder of internet startup insurer Kemper Direct Auto
					and Home which was later acquired by Unitrin Direct.
				</p>

				<p>
					As a Certified Enterprise JAVA Architect for over 20 years,
					I am primarily called upon to assist companies who have a
					bias toward Java-based solutions. As a result, Spring and
					derivative technologies (such as Spring Boot, Spring
					Integration, Spring Data, etc.) have been central to my
					professional toolkit. However, as a full-stack architect and
					developer, I am also well versed in UI application design
					and development based upon Javascript frameworks such as Vue
					and Svelte/SvelteKit. I have also designed numerous APIs and
					micro services that leverage NodeJS, most of which are
					deployed within an AWS cloud environment.
				</p>

				<h3>Education</h3>

				<ul>
					<li>Penn State University (MS Software Engineering)</li>
					<li>Columbia University (MBA)</li>
					<li>Florida State University (BS)</li>
				</ul>

				<h3>Professional Opportunities</h3>

				<p>
					I am currently on a long term engagement with Comcast.
					However, I am available from time to time for part-time
					consulting opportunities as long as it does not violate
					confidentiality or present any conflicts of interest. If you
					would like to contact me further regarding potential
					opportunities, please reach out via
